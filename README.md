Its under the code folder

# How to use it
Go on the releases, download the zip and extract it
Now on windows you MUST run RUN_ME.bat, so that it downloads also the dependencies
On windows you must download and install python, also python MUST be added to path
On linux you MUST run RUN_ME.sh, so that it downloads python with pip AND installs the dependencies
In both cases it runs automatically the app.py
