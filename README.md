It uses mrqrcode library to create, save and show you the mrqrcode

# What are mrqrcodes?
These qr codes are like them, just **long**

# What are going to be the features?
- [X] Make so that you can put custom text
- [ ] Test file
- [ ] Settings for the qr code

# Is it opensource?
Yeah
Just mention me if u are going to use this code

# Where is the code
Its under the code folder

# How to use it
Go on the releases, download the zip and extract it
Now on windows you MUST run RUN_ME.bat, so that it downloads the dependencies.
On windows you must download and install python, and python MUST be added to path

On linux you MUST run RUN_ME.sh, so that it downloads python with pip AND installs the dependencies

In both cases (Windows and Linux) it automatically runs app.py (Where the actual program code is stored)
